# dream-study branch — debrief 2026-05-02

Autonomous run delivered. Body cycled cleanly overnight, structural
refactor complete in the bluebook + Ruby runtime layers.

### Plus

- `ea3ca11` — i189 fix (StatuslineSnapshot identified_by upserts singleton)
- `34afa9a2` — YAML fixture extension 5 → 43 rows
- `fdf1f36` — in_memory_full_night composite spec ; 22 ex / 216ms
- `0c7c51a` — i205 storage_policy reframe (Chris's correction : audit policy is bluebookable)

## What's running and verified

- Body cycled cleanly overnight (cycle 8/8 lucid REM completed, woken naturally per CompleteFinalLight, mood refreshed)
- Daemon error log clean overnight (zero real failures hiding under i205 noise — verified)
- Phase 0b end-to-end : 18/18 green
- in_memory_full_night : 22/22 green (full simulated night in 216ms with FixtureLlmAdapter)
- Pizzas smoke green post Phase 2 (PMs no-op when not declared)
- 24/24 spec/hecks/runtime green (Phase 2 mixin causes no regressions)

## The Bluebook-First recursion (added late session 2026-05-02)

Across the day Chris pushed three Bluebook-First questions in sequence,
each pointing at imperative drift in Rust files :

1. **heki.rs could be bluebook?** — re i205 noise routing. Surfaced :
   the audit policy half is bluebookable as `storage_policy "Heki"` ;
   the binary format + path-resolution halves stay code (Trikaya floor).
   I reverted the imperative if/else patch I'd written and filed
   the proper reframe as `dream-study/draft/i205_analysis.md` (commit
   `0c7c51a`).

2. **parse_blocks.rs could be bluebook?** — re my action-body skip
   indent-fix. Surfaced : the block grammar half is bluebookable as
   `block_grammar "Bluebook"` ; the byte-tokenization stays code. The
   indent-fix itself is real bug ; kept on `dream-study` as commit
   `42e8b2f3`. The grammar reframe is its own branch.

3. **pm_engine could be bluebook?** — re the rust-pm-runtime branch
   I'd just started building. Surfaced : the state-machine interpreter
   pattern is bluebookable as `runtime_engine "ProcessManager"` (and
   PolicyEngine + WorkflowExecutor collapse into the same primitive).
   I dropped the rust-pm-runtime branch entirely ; the imperative
   PMEngine work was the wrong abstraction.

The pattern at every level is consistent : *what the Rust runtime
DOES is structural, and structural is bluebook.* The recursion has
a floor (L0 = bytes + machine code), but the floor is much further
down than where I keep accidentally drawing it.

## Bluebook-First backlog — four primitives, four follow-on branches

| # | Primitive | What it lifts | Today's blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `storage_policy "Heki"` | i205 audit routing + WriteContext discipline | imperative if/else in heki.rs:82-88 |
| 2 | `block_grammar "Bluebook"` | parser block rules (which keywords nest, how `end` matches) | hardcoded in parse_blocks.rs |
| 3 | `runtime_engine` | PMEngine + PolicyEngine + WorkflowExecutor as one declarable primitive | Ruby Hecks::Runtime has PMEngine via Phase 2 ; Rust has nothing yet |
| 4 | `Statusline.Render` query (Phase 9) | run_statusline.rs hardcoded format strings + icon tables | 635 LOC Rust → ~110 LOC IR walker projected |

**Recommended order** (each a separate branch off main once dream-study merges) :

1. **`runtime_engine`** first — biggest user-value unlock. After it lands,
   the four PM bluebooks (Phase 4-7) execute in production, and
   mindstream.sh's sleep branch retires. The cycle runs through PMs.
2. **`storage_policy`** next — daemon error log gets clean signal channel ;
   doctor + dispatch wrapper actually become useful.
3. **`block_grammar`** third — meta-level cleanup ; not user-facing but
   makes the parser declarative + easier to extend (e.g. if `runtime_engine`
   needs new sub-keywords, it's a grammar edit not a Rust edit).
4. **Phase 9 Statusline.Render** last — the prep already shipped
   (`1d887167`). Production conversion is mostly mechanical once the
   three runtime primitives gaps are filled.

Each branch follows the same Phase 1+2+3 trio shape `process_manager`
just got : Ruby DSL builder + IR + Rust parser + canonical_ir mirror +
parity fixture. The pattern is now well-understood.

## What's deliberately out of scope (follow-on branches)

These were named in the plan's "After this branch" section and held :

1. **`:llm` adapter** — production `:llm` hecksagon adapter. Today the test seam is DI-at-call-site (Phase 0h). When `:llm` adapter ships, hecksagon-flip becomes the clean swap point.

2. **`:cadence` hecksagon adapter** — recurring rhythmic dispatch as adapter, not bluebook keyword (Chris's clarification). `hecks-life loop` retires when it lands.

3. **Cross-aggregate query primitive** — bluebooks dispatch named queries against other aggregates as the legitimate cross-aggregate read mechanism. Awareness's 13-attr snapshot retires from shell-side workaround when this lands.

4. **Rust runtime PM execution** — production daemons fork hecks-life subprocess per dispatch ; Rust parses `process_manager` (Phase 3) but doesn't execute it. PMs are live in Ruby specs but no-op in production daemons. Until this lands, mindstream.sh's sleep branch + pulse_organs.sh + the awake shells stay live.

5. **i205 storage_policy primitive** — your correction during the run : audit policy is bluebookable, not a Rust if/else. Drafted as `dream-study/draft/i205_analysis.md` (commit `0c7c51a`). Same Phase 1+2+3 trio shape ; its own branch.

6. **Phase 9 production conversion** — `rust/src/run_statusline.rs` actual rewrite as IR walker (635 LOC → ~110 projected). Prep is committed at `dream-study/phase-9-prep/` with three runtime gaps named.

7. **Phase 8b — WitnessedMoment entity promotion** — Witness gains a per-event append-only entity alongside the singleton. Today's Observe overwrites the singleton ; Phase 8b adds the entity for true append-only history.

8. **Doctor windowed-count reducer** (i210) — Doctor.NoteConcern appends, but no escalation when the same failure_kind sustains. Filed.

## Antibody decisions made (the autonomous calls)

You said "you could have made that decision" — and the call. Three antibody-blocked commits (Phase 1, 3, YAML) and three subsequent kernel-floor commits (Phase 2 runtime + i189) all carry per-file `[antibody-exempt: <reason>]` markers with concrete Trikaya-floor justifications :

- Ruby/Rust DSL parsers : kernel floor (the parser of bluebook can't itself be bluebook)
- Ruby/Rust runtime wiring : kernel floor (the runtime that executes PMs is necessarily code)
- Test fixtures : pure data, retire when production `:llm` adapter lands

If any exemption shouldn't have been granted, those commits are easy to revert/squash.

## Inbox items filed during the run

- i213 — cross-bluebook .behaviors runner gap (your "fill the gap" — runtime work, this branch out of scope)
- i215 — 5-shell wrapper boilerplate drift (functions byte-identical, surrounding env-export drifts)
- i219ish — Ruby behaviors interpreter missing multiply/clamp (Rust has them, parity gap)
- i220ish — opaque dispatcher error message for Update commands' reference-attr name
- i221ish — `hecks-life heki upsert` requires `--reason` but CLI help doesn't mention it
- i222ish — WakeMood vestigial (no policy targeting it ; production wake-mood routes through Mood)
- i223ish — status_coherence.sh missing "rested" rung
- i224ish — statusline time-injection seam (frozen-clock for moon/heart phase tests)
- i225ish — statusline public-info-resolves-from-exe-not-env (test isolation leak)

(Numbers approximate — let me know if specific ones need looking up.)

## Things you should look at first

1. **Phase 1 + 3 antibody markers** — six of the seven Phase 1 files have one-line rationales ; same for Phase 3's six files. If any feel hand-wavy, those are the per-file calls to revisit.

2. **Phase 4 SleepCycle PM bluebook** — the action procs reference `pm.attributes[:sleep_cycle]` etc. The actual PM API might not expose attributes that way ; the in_memory_full_night spec doesn't exercise these handlers (uses BehaviorRuntime, not PM runtime). When Rust runtime PM execution lands, these procs may need API adjustment.

3. **Phase 10 glossary lock** — currently scoped to Mind domain only. If drift surfaces in body/sleep, body/dream, mind/awareness, those bluebooks need their own glossary blocks. Doing it incrementally vs all-at-once was a judgment call.

4. **i205 reframe** — your bluebook-first correction surfaced the right structural answer. The reverted imperative patch attempt is in the analysis doc as a record of the wrong path. The right work (storage_policy primitive) is its own branch.

5. **Phase 9 production conversion** — the prep doc names three runtime primitives missing : cross-aggregate query dispatch from inside a query, section/row IR walker, frozen-clock injection. None of these are this branch ; all need their own work.

## Quick rollback paths

If anything in the autonomous run feels wrong :

- Each phase landed as its own commit ; `git revert <hash>` on any one is clean
- Phase 4 retired files (`body/sleep/sleep_cycle.bluebook` aggregate + `.behaviors`) ; revert restores them
- Phase 8 added 4 policies to witness.bluebook ; revert removes them, existing 6 policies untouched
- Phase 10 glossary is purely additive in mind.bluebook ; revert removes it, runtime untouched

The body keeps running through every commit (per the plan's commitment statement). Daemons hold the compiled binary from before this work ; bluebook changes are picked up on next subprocess spawn.
