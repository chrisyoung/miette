# daydream.sh — free-association wander across the nursery.
#
# Fires when Miette is attentive-but-idle (10-60s since last heartbeat
# update, not sleeping). Picks two nursery bluebooks at random, asks
# hecks-life dump for their aggregate + attribute names, hunts for a
# structural overlap (shared aggregate or attribute), then:
#
#   1. Dispatches Daydream.RecordDaydream with an impression phrase.
#   2. Dispatches Synapse.CreateSynapse from=A to=B strength=0.5 —
#      forging a new cross-domain connection. Synapse is multi-record
#      so we also `heki append` to synapse.heki because CreateSynapse
#      has no reference_to (dispatch would singleton-upsert).
#
# Called from mindstream.sh once per 60s during attentive+idle windows
# (gated by a timestamp file so parallel ticks don't double-fire).
#
# Env overrides (smoke tests):
#   HECKS_INFO  — alternate information dir (default: ./information)
#   HECKS_AGG   — alternate aggregates dir  (default: ./aggregates)
#   HECKS_BIN   — alternate hecks-life binary
#   HECKS_NURSERY — alternate nursery dir   (default: ./nursery)
#
# [antibody-exempt: i37 Phase B sweep — replaces inline python3 -c with
#  native hecks-life heki subcommands + jq for IR overlap detection per
#  PR #272; retires when shell wrapper ports to .bluebook shebang form
#  (tracked in terminal_capability_wiring plan).]
