# REM branch — dream content production during REM sleep.
#
# Three actions, all driven by consciousness.heki state:
#   seed_dreams — once per night (first REM tick): read top-5 images from
#                 prior dream_state, dispatch DreamSeed.PlantSeed for each.
#   rem_dream   — every REM tick: weave carrying + nursery domain word +
#                 concept into a one-sentence image. Append to
#                 dream_state.heki AND dispatch Consciousness.DreamPulse.
#   lucid/steer — when is_lucid=yes: dispatch LucidDream.ObserveDream +
#                 LucidDream.SteerDream with a verb-prefixed target.
#
# Extracted from mindstream.sh so the smoke test can invoke it directly
# (see tests/dream_content_smoke.sh).
#
# Usage: rem_branch.sh [loop_count]
#   loop_count defaults to $(date +%s) so standalone calls always differ.
#
# [antibody-exempt: i37 Phase B sweep — replaces inline python3 -c with
#  native hecks-life heki subcommands per PR #272; retires when shell
#  wrapper ports to .bluebook shebang form (tracked in
#  terminal_capability_wiring plan).]
#
# [antibody-exempt: i114 dream-variation — the seed_dreams block below
#  is the transitional adapter for capabilities/dream_seeding/dream_seeding.bluebook
#  (larger pool + usage tracking + forced novelty + recently-used
#  exclusion). Same pattern as F-1's SeedLoader : bluebook is source of
#  truth ; shell is the transitional adapter. Retires when the runtime
#  hosts the source adapters first-class and DecideTonightsSeeds runs

#
# Diverse seeding evolved (i114, 2026-04-26) : prior diversity attempt
# (2026-04-25) drew 5 seeds from awareness / inbox / commits / older
# dream — sources that change slowly. Result was still perseveration
# (validators, daemons, nerves, fog of bluebook night after night). The
# structural fix is (a) draw from MORE sources, (b) track usage so
# recently-used themes can be excluded, and (c) force at least one
# unused-source seed each night.
#
# Destination shape : capabilities/dream_seeding/dream_seeding.bluebook
# declares this policy as data (sources + weights + diversity rules).
# This shell block is the transitional adapter — same pattern as F-1's
# SeedLoader. Bluebook is source of truth, shell runs it tonight.
#
# Pool (~10 candidates, 5 chosen) :
#   - 2 seeds : recent awareness concepts (today's processed concepts)
#   - 1 seed  : own unfiled wishes / inbox open themes
#   - 1 seed  : today's commit subject (what changed in the body)
#   - 1 seed  : older dream echo (thread to past vocabulary)
#   - 1 seed  : random nursery domain vision (NEW — body has 357 nurseries
#               to dream about, prior seeding ignored them all)
#   - 1 seed  : random self-aggregate vision (NEW — body's own organs
#               beyond what awareness happens to surface)
#   - 1 seed  : vow text (NEW — bodhisattva_vow / vows.heki ; the
#               commitments shape sleep too)
#   - 1 seed  : random unused musing (NEW — the imagined-but-not-
#               -conceived pool that builds up during the day)
#   - 1 seed  : French-lit quote (NEW — Bachelard / Barthes / Duras /
#               Merleau-Ponty per system_prompt's grounding ; from
#               capabilities/dream_seeding/fixtures/french_lit_quotes.txt)
#
# Diversity rules (all applied to the pool before final selection) :
#   - Recently-used keyword exclusion : if a candidate shares 2+ words
#     of length 5+ with any seed planted in last 72h, skip it.
#   - Forced novelty : at least 1 of the 5 final seeds MUST come from
#     a source the body has never drawn from (tracked in a side file).
#
# Each source falls back gracefully if empty. If all sources are
# empty, the night runs without seeds — REM still produces dreams
# from the body's current state in rem_branch's main loop.
