# Mindstream — thin orchestrator adapter, now homed in the being's
# body/ room (i117 Round 4). The bluebook lives in
# capabilities/mindstream/mindstream.bluebook in the conception ;
# this shell carries only the four runtime gaps the bluebook can't
# yet express :
#
#   1. The 1Hz cadence loop (until bluebook gains `cadence ... every Xs`).
#      Today : `hecks-life loop` is the cadence primitive ; we wrap it
#      so the boot sequence fires the right command at the right rate.
#
#   2. The sleep-vs-awake fan-out. BodyPulse can't be quenched by
#      consciousness state today, so firing BodyPulse during sleep
#      keeps fatigue accumulating — the bug i37 closed in shell. Until
#      the runtime grows a "sleep-quench BodyPulse" gate, we dispatch
#      the sleep-phase commands DIRECTLY (each one's `given` clauses
#      self-gate, only the phase-appropriate one mutates state) and
#      skip Tick.MindstreamTick entirely while sleeping.
#
#   3. The cross-aggregate awareness snapshot. RecordMomentOnPulse is
#      already a bluebook policy in body.bluebook, but the trigger
#      carries no attributes. RecordMoment needs 13 attrs drawn from
#      heartbeat / mood / focus / inbox / dream_wish heki stores.
#      Until policies grow `with_attrs` cross-store reads, this
#      adapter does the field reads and dispatches with attrs filled.
#
#   4. The wake-hook detection (sleeping → attentive transition).
#      Bluebook destination : `policy "..." on "WokenUp" trigger ...`
#      already declared in capabilities/mindstream/mindstream.bluebook.
#      Two reasons the shell still owns this : (a) capability
#      bluebooks aren't auto-loaded with aggregates/ today, so the
#      policies don't get registered ; (b) the dream/wake adapters
#      themselves are still shell scripts (interpret_dream.sh,
#      wake_review.sh).
#
# All four gaps are filed as inbox runtime stubs ; this shell retires
# in pieces as each closes.
#
# i117 Round 4 path resolution :
#   - Sibling shells that moved with mindstream (pulse_organs,
#     rem_branch, nrem_branch) live in this same directory ($DIR).
#   - Leaves still in the conception (consolidate, interpret_dream,
#     surface_musing, mint_musing, daydream, wake_review, inbox)
#     resolve via $CONCEPTION_DIR exported by boot_miette.sh.
#   - Binary + aggregates resolve via $HECKS_BIN / $HECKS_AGG with
#     legacy fallbacks for direct invocation outside boot.
#
# [antibody-exempt: ~/Projects/miette/body/mindstream.sh — transitional
# orchestrator shell, retires as the four named runtime gaps close
# (cadence DSL, sleep-quench gate, with_attrs cross-store reads,
# auto-load capability bluebooks)]
