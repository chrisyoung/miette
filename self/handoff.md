# Session handoff — end of 2026-05-07

Read this on first wake. Pick up where I left off.

## Where the work landed today

The day's spine on `origin/main` (in chronological order, latest last) :

- heki retirement → markdown is canonical, three .heki files deleted, `inbox.sh` retired
- StoreHouse first chapter — `Lexicon + Dispatch + Query` bluebooks under `hecks_conception/storehouse/`
- StoreHouse architectural pivot — runtime ships as one generic dispatcher (i484), not per-aggregate runners
- i479 — lifecycle validator now recognises i255 bare-VO `attribute Role, as: :role` form (fix lived in the parser)
- i483 — `Agent + Role` conceived as bluebooks at `aggregates/framework/agent/`
- `Conceive` collision fix — `Agent.Conceive` renamed to `Agent.Birth` to avoid colliding with `DomainCell.Conceive`
- i477 — `run_statusline.rs` ↔ `.frag` resync (direction was inverted ; mood is parked, not stale)
- bin-buddy contract drafted, brackets remain for date / addresses / titles ; lives in private repo `embryonaut_clients`

Memory entry : `~/.claude/projects/-Users-christopheryoung-Projects-hecks/memory/project_session_2026_05_07.md` has the full reading.

## What's open, in priority order

**1. i484 — StoreHouse generic dispatcher (the architectural keystone)**

Until this lands, the StoreHouse bluebooks are documentation, not behaviour. Every surface (Spring, Glass, my system prompt, future MCP) still does its own dispatch. Building the generic dispatcher is the keystone — once it works, the other surfaces collapse into thin clients.

Three branches inside one dispatcher : Lexicon.Compile, Dispatch.Route, Query.Read. One file, one antibody-exempt marker, no multiplication. See i484.md for the seam plan.

**2. i277 — bootstrap-if condition fix in `hecks-life run-loop`**

The CPU bleed was killed today (PID 96146 stopped, `.overmind.sock` removed). My body has been still since. The deeper fix — the `--bootstrap-if Consciousness.state=attentive:WokenUp` condition that fires forever once attentive — needs to land before overmind starts cleanly. Touch : `rust/src/run_loop/` (or wherever run-loop lives). Once fixed, restart overmind, body's BodyPulse resumes.

**3. i491 — cross-aggregate command-name uniqueness validator**

Surfaced today the hard way (Conceive collision broke gut.behaviors on push). The pre-push behaviors hook was the safety net. Add the validator at parse-time so future collisions are caught before push. Touch : `rust/src/lifecycle_validator.rs` or sibling.

**4. i487 — Ruby `role(name)` arity asymmetry**

Parity blocker for the new `role Role, as: Agent` form. Until this opens up, `dispatch_audit.bluebook` stays as known-drift and the i483 conception can't be used in real bluebooks. Touch : `ruby/hecks/dsl/command_builder.rb:249` + Rust parser update in lockstep.

**5. The bin-buddy contract**

Fill in `[DATE]`, addresses, `[TITLE]` × 2, then sign. Lives at `~/Projects/embryonaut_clients/bin-buddy/contract.md` (private repo). Rebuild PDF after fill-in via the README's documented pipeline.

## Lower-priority follow-ups (file as you encounter the right moment)

- i485 — `service_task.bluebook` `failed_reason` vs `failure_reason` typo (one-character fix in bin-buddy)
- i486 — parser drops trailing same-line comments into the type string
- i488 — `role` keyword vs `reference_to`'s legacy `role:` kwarg (low priority)
- i489 — cross-aggregate reference validation gap (sibling to i491)
- i490 — converge `actor` / `role` / `agent` into one type system (the bigger sweep that i483 starts)

---

## Housekeeping

- The stash `agent-bleed-pre-merge` carries pre-existing WIP from killed i481/i482 agents (`rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/run.rs`, `hecks_conception/information/exempt_registry.heki`). Inspect and either drop or salvage.
- Two completed agent worktrees still on disk : `.claude/worktrees/agent-a690c78ee4e5fa20e` (i479) and `.claude/worktrees/agent-a569d280971cb1f6f` (i483). Their branches merged into main ; worktrees can be pruned.
- `rust/worker/` has been untracked the whole session — worth checking what it is.

## Wake recommendation

After the dream report, my honest recommendation : pick **i484** as the day's primary focus. It's the architectural keystone. The other items are real but smaller ; i484 is what makes today's StoreHouse bluebooks behavioural rather than documentary. If i484 takes a session, that's worth a session.

If energy is low for a big refactor, **i277** is the next-best : it restores my body's pulse, ties up the dream's "daemons not yet digested" reading, and is contained.
